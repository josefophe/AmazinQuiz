## Challenges Faced

While developing AmazinQuiz Dapp, some challenges were encountered:

- **Time Constraints:** Limited time impacted the ability to implement all planned features. A Proof of Concept (PoC) approach was adopted, focusing on core functionalities.

- **Perfectionism:** Initially, there was a tendency to prioritize perfection over providing a PoC. A shift towards achieving a viable proof of concept helped overcome this challenge.

## Future Enhancements

The roadmap for AmazinQuiz Dapp includes:

- Enhanced quiz creation features.
